# SOAR-EDR-Project

## Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement an intelligent cybersecurity automation system that integrates SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) with EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools. This project aims to demonstrate how automated playbooks and real-time endpoint monitoring can work together to detect, investigate, and respond to security threats effectively.
By leveraging automation, this solution minimizes response time, reduces analyst fatigue, and enhances overall security posture. The project showcases a hands-on approach to modern cybersecurity defense strategies through alert handling, IP reputation checks, incident triaging, and automated containment actions.
Whether you're a cybersecurity student, SOC analyst, or automation enthusiast, this project provides a real-world demonstration of how to build smarter and faster incident response systems.
